## plan

create a crypto currency in a day in a language like haskell that allows family members to use crypto for goods or services

## ideas

* call it "fam coin" or "tribe coin" and have it be extendible to friends and all in-circle peeps
* we could hedge against 51% attacks by making it invite-only
* for mining, the hash to guess is a pose that you must guess - testing your creativity and getting an exercise  
* have craigslist-like listings for goods or services that you must pay with with the coin

## how it works

* download the miner
* run the miner locally
* your coins will accumulate in a file called weberco.in 
* spend your coins at the weber store
