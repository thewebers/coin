-- when you have something that's a parenthesis soup, like (getFolds terry (numFolds (belly terry)))
-- you can remove some of those by using `$`, like `getFolds terry $ numFolds $ belly terry`
-- basically, whenever you have `func (<some complicated expression with lots of
-- parens>)`, you can clean it up as `func $ <complicated expr>`, and you can do that recursively.
